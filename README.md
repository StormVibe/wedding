# Simple Wedding website
This is heavily inspired by [@rampatra] (https://github.com//rampatra/wedding-website) wedding website
However, quite a few changes have been made to be less bulky. I essentially restarted it from scratch.
This is just a simple website for a wedding
Nothing fancy, and no API calls, NPM modules, or any video backgrounds (though I might add that video back in the future, but seemed to be taking a lot longer to load). 

## It includes:
1. __RSVP__ - Revamped from [@rampatra's] (https://github.com//rampatra/wedding-website) version where all of the code verification happens in the app script. 
The hash is no longer exposed to the client. 
There are no NPM Modules being used
2. __Photos__ - Added an additional web page for photos. We can upload it with our wedding pictures after the wedding
3. __Blog__ - Added an additional web page for a blog
4. __Mailing List__ - Added a mailing list in the blog website that people can subscribe to. 
It just goes to a google sheets doc and emails me when it is updated.
